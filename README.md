## Project Description
Our project aims to revolutionize organization and planning for both teachers and students through a comprehensive teacher and student planning software. With features like calendar viewing, assignment creation, event tracking, and alarm setting, users can seamlessly manage their schedules. The system offers unique functionalities such as exporting calendars with attached notes and images, facilitating communication and organization. It distinguishes itself by catering to the specific needs of educators and learners, enhancing efficiency and productivity in academic settings. Additionally, the software ensures security measures, such as preventing erroneous data inputs, to maintain data integrity and user confidence.

The choice of technologies for our project was carefully considered to optimize functionality, efficiency, and ease of development. Operating systems compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux ensures broad accessibility. JavaScript and TypeScript were selected for their versatility and extensive support within the development community. HTML, CSS, and JSX enable seamless integration of frontend components, with Tailwind CSS streamlining styling for improved readability. We decided to use React and Next.js for the front end because they're reliable and flexible. They can handle various tasks effectively and are adaptable as our project evolves. Firebase serves as the backend and database solution due to its convenience, reliability, and integrated services like Authentication and Cloud File Storage. While connecting our application to Google's ecosystem does have its drawbacks, the unified backend console streamlines development and boosts efficiency. Pair programming facilitates knowledge sharing and skill development among team members, ensuring smooth implementation across the project phases. Despite potential challenges in migrating to alternative providers in the future, Firebase's proven reliability and convenience align with our project's goals and team expertise.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run all the installs:

```bash
npm install
```


Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
